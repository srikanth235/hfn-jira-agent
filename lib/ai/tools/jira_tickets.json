    "Description": "Dear Sister / Brother,\nAs you may be aware we have 6 numbers of HeartMath random number generators (RNG) devices presently installed in the electrical / media room behind the stage, which are subjected to heavy electro-magnetic wave interferences leading to signal drop. To avoid such interference, these devices need to be relocated elsewhere in and around meditation hall. A joint site visit was made yesterday (16.01.2025) by Vineet Bhai, Vikram Bhai, and me to identify a suitable location to shift these devices with enhanced number of devices (20-24) shortly, It was decided that we would relocate these devices in the existing cable shaft on the sister side of the meditation hall. Based on my discussions with Vikram Bhai and IT team today, the following items are required for the installation of the devices:\n\n\n1. Fibreoptic UP link for internet\n2. 24 Port Switch - 1 No. \n3. 2 M cat 6 cable - 24 not.\nConsidering the urgency to commission the system before the February Bhandara, may I request that the above items may kindly be procured / provided on urgent basis.Warm regards,Satya Mandal",

To avoid such interference, these devices need to be relocated elsewhere in and around meditation hall. A joint site visit was made yesterday (16.01.2025) by Vineet Bhai, Vikram Bhai, and me to identify a suitable location to shift these devices with enhanced number of devices (20-24) shortly, It was decided that we would relocate these devices in the existing cable shaft on the sister side of the meditation hall. Based on my discussions with Vikram Bhai and IT team today, the following items are required for the installation of the devices:\n\n\n1. Fibreoptic UP link for internet\n2. 24 Port Switch - 1 No.\n3. 2 M cat 6 cable - 24 not.\nConsidering the urgency to commission the system before the February Bhandara, may I request that the above items may kindly be procured / provided on urgent basis.Warm regards,Satya Mandal",
